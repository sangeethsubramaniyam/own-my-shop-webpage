  <p class="fst-p">Tacos can be contrasted with similar foods such as burritos, which are often much larger and rolled rather than folded; taquitos, which are rolled and fried; or chalupas/tostadas, in which the tortilla is fried before filling.

    Indigenous origins are also proposed. One possibility is that the word derives from the Nahuatl word tlahco, meaning "half" or "in the middle",[11] in the sense that food would be placed in the middle of a tortilla.[12] Furthermore, dishes analogous to the taco were known to have existed in Pre-Columbian society—for example, the Nahuatl word tlaxcalli (a type of corn tortilla).[11]

  <p class="snd-p">A <span>taco </span>(US: /ˈtɑːkoʊ/, UK: /ˈtækoʊ/, Spanish: [ˈtako]) is a traditional Mexican dish consisting of a small hand-sized corn- or wheat-based tortilla topped with a filling. The tortilla is then folded around the filling and eaten by hand. A taco can be made with a variety of fillings, including beef, pork, chicken, seafood, beans, vegetables, and cheese, and garnished with various condiments, such as salsa, guacamole, or sour cream, and vegetables, such as lettuce, onion, tomatoes, and chiles.[1] Tacos are a common form of antojitos, or Mexican street food, which have spread around the world.[2]
